Calculates [Clebsch–Gordan coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients) and Wigner [3-jm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-j_symbol), [6-j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-j_symbol), and [9-j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-j_symbol), and 12-j symbols exactly.  They are often used for coupling and recoupling angular momenta in quantum mechanics.  Based on the [Haskell version of `wigner-symbols`](https://github.com/Rufflewind/wigner-symbols).

The definition of 12-j symbols is based on the equation (19.3) of the following textbook.

* A. P. Yutsis, I. B. Levinson, and V. V. Vanagas, *Mathematical Apparatus of the Theory of Angular Momentum* (Israel Program for Scientific Translations, Jerusalem, 1962).
